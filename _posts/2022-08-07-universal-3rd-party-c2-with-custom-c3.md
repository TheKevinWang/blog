Coming Soon! C3 is great but takes too much work to get a new C2 framework to work with it, and hasn't been fully updated. The included covenant connector doesn't even work anymore. I am improving C3 to also work using a http proxy for the client interface and a custom server http piece that emulates client connections for the server interface. Nearly all C2 frameworks support http proxy and http reverse connections.
